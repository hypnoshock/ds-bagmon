Original Tamagotchi
===================

Baby lasts about an hour (cannot die)
Child, Teen, Adult is about 2 to 3 days each

Egg: This stage only lasts a few minutes until the Tamagotchi pet hatches into a baby alien. No care is required during this stage.
Baby: This stage lasts around an hour. The baby sprite is small and requires the most amount of care. Baby Tamagotchi cannot die.
Child: This stage lasts from one to three days depending on the Tamagotchi version. The sprite form is usually simple and round.
Teen: This stage lasts two to three days on average. The sprite grows and obtains appendages. Previous care can affect the appearance in this stage.
Adult: This is the final stage for most Tamagotchi pets. After a few days as adults, the Tamagotchi can marry and make more Tamagotchi eggs, repeating the cycle.
Senior: This stage only happens in recent Tamagotchi models. These sprites look older and may have canes. They remain seniors until they pass away.
